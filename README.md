# Machine-Learning-for-Classification
In this project students will learn how to use machine learning tools to test
different algorithms for classification tasks.
Specifications: You need to compare different machine learning algorithms for a
classification task using WEKA. Each group has to choose one dataset to experiment
with based on the last digit of the least student id in the team mod3 as follows:
No. Dataset
0 Speaker Accent Recognition Dataset (Link)
1 Early stage diabetes risk prediction Dataset (Link)
2 Raisin Dataset (Link)
You have to test at least 3 models: Decision Tree, Na√Øve Bayes, and MLP. For each
model make sure to do the following:
- Preprocess at least one attribute (e.g., discretization of continuous attributes).
- Test the model using 5-fold cross validation and report the confusion matrix,
accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Change at least one hyper-parameter of the model and study its effect.
